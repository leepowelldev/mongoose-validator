# Mongoose Validator

[![Test](https://github.com/leepowelldev/mongoose-validator/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/leepowelldev/mongoose-validator/actions/workflows/test.yml)

Validators for [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com) schemas utilising [validator.js](https://github.com/chriso/validator.js).

Mongoose Validator simply returns Mongoose style validation objects that utilises validator.js for the data validation.

Version 1.0.x has been refactored to support a simpler interface and also validator.js 3.0.x

**NOTE**: If you were using 0.2.x with your projects please be aware that upgrading to 1.0.x will break them. As of validator.js 3.0.x - many of the available validators have been changed. For example, 'regex' validator no longer exists and has been replaced with 'matches'.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm i mongoose-validator -S
```

### Legacy install

If you need to install the 0.2.2 release, use the following command:

```bash
$ npm i mongoose-validator@0.2.2 -S
```

More details on 0.2.2 can be found [here](https://github.com/leepowellcouk/mongoose-validator/blob/0.2.2/README.md)

## Usage

```javascript
var mongoose = require('mongoose');
var validate = require('mongoose-validator');

var nameValidator = [
  validate({
    validator: 'isLength',
    arguments: [3, 50],
    message: 'Name should be between {ARGS[0]} and {ARGS[1]} characters',
  }),
  validate({
    validator: 'isAlphanumeric',
    passIfEmpty: true,
    message: 'Name should contain alpha-numeric characters only',
  }),
];

var Schema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true, validate: nameValidator },
});
```

Error objects are returned as normal via Mongoose.

## Options

### option.validator {string} or {function} - required

Name of the validator or a custom function you wish to use, this can be any one of the [built-in validator.js validators](https://github.com/chriso/validator.js/#validators), or a [custom validator](#custom-validators).

### option.arguments - optional

Arguments to be passed to the validator. These can either be an array of arguments (for validators that can accept more than one i.e. `isLength`), or a single argument as any type.

### option.passIfEmpty {boolean} - optional - default: false

Some of the validator.js validators require a value to check against (isEmail, isUrl etc). There may be instances where you don't have a value to check i.e. a path that is not required and as such these few validators return an false value causing validation to fail. This can now be bypassed by setting the `passIfEmpty` option.

### option.message - optional

Set the error message to be used should the validator fail. If no error message is set then mongoose-validator will attempt to use one of the built-in default messages, if it can't then a simple message of 'Error' will be returned. Enhanced message templating is supported by giving the ability to use the validator arguments. You can use these like `{ARGS[argument index position]}`. Note: Use `{ARGS[0]}` if your arguments isn't an array.

```javascript
validate({
  validator: 'isLength',
  arguments: [3, 50],
  message: 'Name should be between {ARGS[0]} and {ARGS[1]} characters'
}),

// On error produces: Name should be between 3 and 50 characters
```

The built in Mongoose message template variables still work as expected. You can find out more about those here: [http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#error_messages_MongooseError-messages](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#error_messages_MongooseError-messages)

### option.type - optional

Set the type of validator type. If this is not defined, Mongoose will set this for you. Read more about this here: [http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#schematype_SchemaType-validate](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#schematype_SchemaType-validate)

### Extending the error properties (mongoose version >= 3.9.7)

Any additional members added to the options object will be available in the 'err.properties' field of the mongoose validation error.

```javascript
var alphaValidator = validate({
  validator: 'isAlphanumeric',
  passIfEmpty: true,
  message: 'Name should contain alpha-numeric characters only',
  httpStatus: 400,
});
```

In this example the error object returned by mongoose will have its 'properties' extended with httpStatus should validation fail. More details can be found about this here: [http://thecodebarbarian.com/2014/12/19/mongoose-397](http://thecodebarbarian.com/2014/12/19/mongoose-397)

## Async validators

By default Mongoose runs all validators synchronously, if you need to perform asynchronous validation you can do so by returning a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) from your validator.

```javascript
validate({
  validator: function (val) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        resolve(val > 0);
      }, 500);
    });
  },
  message: 'Count must be a positive number.',
});
```

## Custom validators

Custom validators can also be added - these are then added to the validator.js object.
**NOTE**: Validator.js converts all values to strings internally for built-in validators - however custom validators do _not_ do this. This allows you to create custom validators for checking all types such as arrays and objects.

```javascript
// extend([method name], [validator], [default error message])

var extend = require('mongoose-validator').extend;

extend(
  'isString',
  function (val) {
    return Object.prototype.toString.call(val) === '[object String]';
  },
  'Not a string'
);
```

Custom validators are called normally:

```javascript
validate({
  validator: 'isString',
});
```

Custom validator can be passed directly as a function:

```javascript
validate({
  validator: function (val) {
    return val > 0;
  },
  message: 'Count must be a positive number.',
});
```

NOTE: As per validator.js documentation, the currently tested value is accessed through the first argument that is automatically passed to the validator function.

## Regular Expressions

Mongoose Validator can use the validator.js `matches` method, however, it's worth noting that the regex can be passed in 2 ways - as per the validator.js documentation, firstly they can be passed as a literal:

```javascript
validate({
  validator: 'matches',
  arguments: /^[a-zA-Z\-]+$/i,
});
```

or as a string with a further argument containing any required modifiers:

```javascript
validate({
  validator: 'matches',
  arguments: ['^[a-zA-Z-]+$', 'i'],
});
```

Special thanks to [Francesco Pasqua](https://github.com/cesconix/) for heavily refactoring the code into something far more future proof. Thanks also go to [Igor Escobar](https://github.com/igorescobar/) and [Todd Bluhm](https://github.com/toddbluhm/) for their contributions.
